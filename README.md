## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are a few Python libraries needed for running all the included notebooks. However, Anaconda distribution of Python includes those. The code shold run using Python version 3.*

## Project Motivation <a name="installation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results dataset to understand and share the following insights:
1. How average Job Satisfaction varies across various organization types? This  could guide us about which organization to approach for job opportunities.
2. Whether organization offering more money is likely to provide higher level of Job Satisfaction?
3. Does better work equipment influence employees' job satisfaction?
4. When an employer trusts its employees, does that benefit the employer too?

## File Description <a name="files"></a>

There are two Jupyter notebooks available to showcase work related to the questions raised above. These code files are:

1. Blog-Post-Business-Questions.ipynb - Perform Business Questions and their answers
2. Blog-Post-Exploratory-Data-Analysis.ipynb - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis of Stack Overflow survey data

There are two data files both of which should be place in the same folder as the code files:
1. survey_results_public.csv - Stack Overflow survey data file
2. survey_results_schema.csv - Survey questions with their descriptions

Kaggle link for the both of the data files are [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017)

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/Sankar_ray/.....)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
